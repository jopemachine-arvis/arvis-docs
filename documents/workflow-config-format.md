# [How to write arvis workflow](./workflow-develop.md) â†’ `arvis-workflow.json` format

The json file consists of the following attributes.

## Usable variable

Certain values in the Json file are replaced by arvis.

### Special variables (`{query}`, `{clipboard}`, `$1`, `$2`..)

`{query}` is replaced with user's input (query not including the `command`).

`{clipboard}` is replaced with user's clipboard string.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "keyword",
  "command": "test",
  "title": "Test",
  "actions": [
    {
      "modifiers": "normal",
      "type": "script",
      "script": "node abc.js '{query}'"
    }
  ]
}
```

In above example, when user input is `test abc def`, `{query}` is `abc def`,

and `$1` is `abc`, `$2` is `def`.

### Variables

You can set `variables` in your scriptfilter's script or `arvis-workflow.json` config file.

All variable could be used in form of `{var:some_var}` in the config file.

Example:
```json
{
  "variable": {
    "some_var": ""
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "keyword",
      "command": "test",
      "title": "Test",
      "actions": [
        {
          "modifiers": "normal",
          "type": "script",
          "script": "node abc.js '{var:some_var}' '{query}'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
