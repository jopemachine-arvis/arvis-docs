# [How to write arvis plugin](./plugin-develop.md) â†’ Plugin items format

The `main` function of the plugin must return an array of below format as `items`.

You can check minimal working example of plugin in [Here](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvis-calculator-plugin-example)

## `title`

type: `string`

required: `true`

The most visible text in the item.

Plugin items are sorted with `title` in Arvis.

So, `items`'s order is ignored.

If you want to not sort your plugin item, use `noSort` option.

Note that `noSort` is true, your plugin items will be positioned most below position.

## `command`

type: `string`

required: `false`

If you want to sort your plugin item not using `title`, use `command`.

If command is specified, Arvis sort plugin items by command, not title.

But note that the difference between commands and titles can cause confusion to users.

## `subtitle`

type: `string`

required: `false`

A additional description of the command to display in the search window.

## `arg`

type: `string | object`

required: `false`

Forward argument to next action's `{query}`.

If arg is `string`, replace `{query}` with forwared `arg`.

If arg is `object`, enables the key value pairs to be used.

## `icon`

type: `string | object`

required: `false`

Image to display on item.

If icon is `string`, it will be treated as file path.

You can forward icon like below way too.

```js
icon: {
  path: `${__dirname}/icon.png`
}
```

## `text`

type: `string | object`

required: `false`

When user focus the item, press ctrl (or cmd) + c, user get copied `text`.

And when user focus the item, press ctrl (or cmd) + l, the text will be displayed in Large text window.

You can give these texts in below way.

You can forward `text` like below way too.

```js
text: {
  copy: `some-text`,
  largeType: 'some-text`,
}
```

If `text` is `string`, it would be `copy` and `largeType` both.

## `valid`

type: `boolean`

required: `false`

default value is `true`.

If valid is `false`, the item is treated error messages.

You can show error message through setting `valid` to false.  

## `quicklook`

type: `object`

required: `false`

arvisOnly: `true`

Users can press the `shift + space` key above the item to open the quicklook.

The data handed over is explicitly displayed in the quicklook.

If you do not specify a quicklook, the arvis will infer the data to display.

Recommend specifying `quicklook` value for explicit data display.

### type

type: `string (enum)`

required: `true`

values: `html` | `image` | `markdown` | `text` | `pdf`

### data

type: `string | Promise<string>`

required: `true`

You can forward Promise returning string to data.

Then the promise is resolved when user opens the quicklook.

This is useful you don't want to execute the rendering script because it has some heavy async operations.

Note that:

* html, image, pdf, text : file path (or url) to display

* markdown: markdown text string

## `quicklookurl`

type: `string`

required: `false`

Users can press the `shift + space` key above the item to open the quicklook.

You can consider `quicklookurl` as shortcut of `quicklook` object with html type.

## `mods`

type: `object`

required: `false`

You can replace some attributes with different value while the modifier key is pressed like below way.

```js
mods: {
    "alt": {
        "title: "",
        "subtitle": ""
    },
    "cmd": {
        "title: "",
        "subtitle": ""
    },
}
```

## `variables`

type: `object`

required: `false`

The key-value pairs in the `variables` object are put in form of `{var:key} = value`.

### Difference with `arg` 

1. In, `variables`, the keys becomes `{var:key}`

2. `variables` is saved in environment variables. So, you can use the variable values in your scripts too. (`arg` cannot be used).
