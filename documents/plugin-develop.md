# [Plugins intro](./plugin-intro.md) â†’ How to write arvis plugin

## Support hotload

All changes in workflow, plugin folders's changes are being watched and reflected when they are created.

## Use [arvish](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvish) to build your plugin

1. Write proper `arvis-plugin.json`.

2. Write some scripts to use in your `plugin`.

3. Type `arvish build` on your project root.

## `arvis-plugin.json` format

`arvis-plugin.json` format is very similar with `arvis-workflow.json` format.

### Action

[Click me to check Action](./action-description.md)

### Entry point of plugin (`main`)

The js file specified in `main` is entry point of the `plugin`, which means this is imported by `Arvis` in runtime.

This file should export below form's function to be properly imported.

You can also use `async-await` syntax to this to handle some async operation.

```js
module.exports = ({ inputStr, history }) => {
  ...
 
  return {
    items: []
  }
};
```

You can check minimal working [plugin example](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvis-calculator-plugin-example) here.

#### Arguments

##### inputStr

type: `string`

String entered by user

##### history

type: `array`

[Click me to check history schema](./history.md)

#### Return value

##### items

type: `array`

required: `true`

[Click me to check items schema](./plugin-items-format-description.md)

##### noSort

type: `boolean`

required: `false`

defalult value: `false`

If you want to not sort your plugin item, use `noSort` option.

Note that `noSort` is true, your plugin items will be positioned most below position.

## JSON Schema

Recommend to use the [JSON schema](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvis-extension-validator/blob/master/plugin-schema.json) below when creating `plugin`.

You can simply create arvis-plugin skeleton file using the schema by [arvish](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvish).

## Available Environment variable

Both `workflows` and `plugin` set useful environment variables when running scripts.

You can use the variables you want in your script.

## Arvish

If you are familiar with `Alfy`, you can try to use [arvish](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvish) in your js scripts.
